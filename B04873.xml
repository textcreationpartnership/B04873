            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE <hi>Protestants Ave Mary,</hi> ON THE Arrival of Her most Gracious Majesty, MARY, Queen of England.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>HAIL all that's Great or Good! and let the Hail</l>
               <l>Oer spread Three Kingdoms, and like Truth prevail:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Hail Mary!</hi> 'twas of old the Voice of Heaven;</l>
               <l>Nor are we Mortals of our share bereaven.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Hail Mary full of Grace!</hi> speaks yet more clear,</l>
               <l>Since ev'ry Vertue is Constellate here.</l>
               <l>And all the Graces so entirely meet,</l>
               <l>That nothing less could such a Princess Greet.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Nor rest we here: <hi>The LORD is with thee too:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Or thy Great Lord could ne'er such Wonders do.</l>
               <l>Wonders! may well th' alarum'd World Surprize;</l>
               <l>It was of GOD, and marvellous in our Eyes!</l>
               <l>Wonders! as put its Motion to a stand,</l>
               <l>And not His Finger speaks, but Mighty Hand.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Advance yet higher, and pursue the Hind;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Blessed art thou amongst all Womankind:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Since thou com'st cloath'd with Innocence and Peace,</l>
               <l>And bring'st the Charms, to make our Tempests cease:</l>
               <l>Since by thy Vertues we shall now Retreive</l>
               <l>Our gasping Laws, and gain them a Reprieve.</l>
               <l>Thy <hi>WILLIAM</hi>'s maintain'd Ray will restore,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>England</hi> the Lustre it enjoy'd before;</l>
               <l>Our shatter'd Liberties and Laws maintain,</l>
               <l>And calmly Anchor Church and State again.</l>
               <l>But oh! We grieve, that yet, we can't apply,</l>
               <l>The last Division of that <hi>Rosary.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>We Wish, we Hope, we Pray, and will Pray on,</l>
               <l>Till we have gain'd Heaven's Favour in a SON:</l>
               <l>That then we may the whole Salute repeat,</l>
               <l>And make our Joys, as well as That compleat.</l>
               <l>Ye Miter'd Heads assist, call to Assize,</l>
               <l>Your strongest Zeals, and with them storm the Skies;</l>
               <l>We know, that fervent Prayer did never fail,</l>
               <l>And let <hi>Rome</hi> know, such Hereticks can prevail,</l>
               <l>And with a Holy Violence pluck down,</l>
               <l>A real Issue to support the Crown,</l>
               <l>Whilst their Addresses to <hi>Loretto</hi> made,</l>
               <l>Did only gain a Son in Masquerade.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus we, to our Great <hi>MARY,</hi> pay our Hails,</l>
               <l>With Hearts as full, and swelling as her Sails;</l>
               <l>Thanks Winds, and Seas, and Ships, that wafted o'er,</l>
               <l>Our Blessed LADY to the <hi>British</hi> Shore.</l>
               <l>But above all, Thanks be to Heaven alone,</l>
               <l>That led Her from a State, unto a Throne;</l>
               <pb facs="tcp:176044:2"/>
               <l>Where She will hold (guided by th' Hand of GOD)</l>
               <l>The Dovelike Scepter, not an Iron Rod:</l>
               <l>So our late Model, She may them Reform,</l>
               <l>And with true <hi>English</hi> Interest perform,</l>
               <l>What <hi>James</hi> first promis'd; and advance our Glory,</l>
               <l>Beyond the Limits of Ancestral Story:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For what can't <hi>England</hi> do, would she awake?</l>
               <l>Give Laws to <hi>Europe,</hi> and make Empires shake.</l>
               <l>Keep Mistress of the Undisputed Maine,</l>
               <l>And hold the Ballance Just, 'twixt <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And once more make her useless Cannons Roar,</l>
               <l>Through both the <hi>Indies,</hi> and bring back their Ore.</l>
               <l>Search out new World, and Conquer old Ones too,</l>
               <l>Bomb <hi>Mexico,</hi> and Subjugate <hi>Peru:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Beard the Proud <hi>Sophy,</hi> and the Grand <hi>Mogul;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>These are the Rays would make thy Glory full.</l>
               <l>Such mighty Acts, would make a Perfect Reign,</l>
               <l>And our <hi>Great WILLIAM</hi> Conquerour again.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Shame, that our Lions should thus Dormant lye,</l>
               <l>And all our Spirits in a Lethargy;</l>
               <l>What have we done, but sought, what Saint's Day next?</l>
               <l>And our Care was, t' observe the <hi>Jesuits</hi> Text;</l>
               <l>To Court that Miss, to Proselyte this Fool,</l>
               <l>To see that Play, and to make this Man, Tool;</l>
               <l>To undermine, by Closet-work, the Brave,</l>
               <l>To awe the Vertuous, and advance the Knave;</l>
               <l>To hector little Masters of the Arts,</l>
               <l>To study how to lose the Peoples Hearts.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>These were our Works, when <hi>Lobs,</hi> and <hi>Pens,</hi> and <hi>Brents,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Were to our Court the Mighty Ornaments;</l>
               <l>These were the Statesmen cull'd from all the rest,</l>
               <l>Yet, if once try'd, could never stand the Test;</l>
               <l>Since by these little Arts, they vilely made</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>French</hi> Lillies flourish, and our <hi>English</hi> fade.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But now the Scene is chang'd, the Cloud's dispers'd,</l>
               <l>And we reliev'd from all we were oppres'd;</l>
               <l>Our Angel comes, by whose Diviner Ray,</l>
               <l>Darkness is fled, and we salute the Day;</l>
               <l>Welcome, thrice Welcome, to the <hi>Old Whitehal,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Thy Glorious Presence makes us happy all.</l>
               <l>To Providence, and Thee, we ought to raise</l>
               <l>Altars for Thanks, and Pyramids for Praise;</l>
               <l>The Church shall Triumph, and the State Rejoyce,</l>
               <l>And sing <hi>Te Deums</hi> with united Voice:</l>
               <l>So may'st thou be belov'd by Wholes, not Parts,</l>
               <l>And ever live the Regent Queen of Hearts:</l>
               <l>And with it gain all Purses, Arms, and Men,</l>
               <l>Proud to enforce the Treaty <hi>Nimeguen.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Then Visit <hi>Monsieur</hi> with United Powers,</l>
               <l>See <hi>Paris</hi> too, and humble her high Towers;</l>
               <l>Storm the <hi>Bastile,</hi> possess the <hi>Louvre</hi> too;</l>
               <l>What can't <hi>Great WILLIAM</hi> and <hi>Bright MARY</hi> do!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Revenge <hi>Aurange,</hi> and with Confederates call</l>
               <l>Such as shall make his Slaves poor Quakers all.</l>
               <l>Force <hi>Lofty Lowis</hi> Abdicate his Crown,</l>
               <l>Time bars no Prince's Right, 'tis still thy own;</l>
               <l>And when that Mighty Monarch's brought thus low,</l>
